            <b>Gameplan Collegiate Consulting</b> is a guidance service for young student-athletes who
            want to compete in athletics, specifically <b>volleyball,</b> at the collegiate level. The 
            services are geared towards helping these athletes and their families naviagte the 
            recruiting process through a personalized approach, tailored to each individual.

            Maneuvering through the recruiting and admissions process for college can be daunting, and many families
            don't know where to start. Others don't realize that their child has the ability to play at the collegiate level,
            or they lack access to the resources that often help during this developmental time. <b>We believe that if a 
            committed athlete wants to play at the collegiate level, there is a place for that athlete - it's just a matter
            of finding it.</b>   
        </p>
        <p>
            At Gameplan, we have the mindset of setting our clients up for success. Through strategy determination, planning and hard work,
            together we can find the right place for your collegiate experience.
